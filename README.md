# BBC Document Classification (NLP Project)

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify BBC news articles into categories such as business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech.
Using NLTK for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming) and a supervised learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes / Transformer BERT / SVM), the system learns to automatically predict the category of unseen documents.

## Key Features
